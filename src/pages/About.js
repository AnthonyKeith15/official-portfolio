Aside from my work as a React Developer, I enjoy perfecting my aim with Ana playing Overwatch or going to trivia nights with my friends. A life goal of mine is to step foot on in 100 unique countries, and I'm happy to say so far I am at 7! I believe experiencing the world first hand is one of the most rewarding things a person can do, and I'm excited to see where my adventures take me.
